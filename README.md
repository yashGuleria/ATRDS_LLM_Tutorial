# 🛠️ <strong> Hands-On Exercise: Air Traffic Scenario Generation with LLMs</strong>

---

## 🧩 Problem Introduction

This exercise focuses on the **generation of synthetic air traffic scenarios** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Participants will explore how to leverage LLMs to create realistic and coherent air traffic scenario data, simulating operational airspace environments for downstream applications such as simulation, training, or decision-support systems.

---

## 📌 Case Study Objective

**Problem Statement**: Develop a methodology for generating structured air traffic scenarios using LLMs. The scenarios should reflect realistic airspace configurations and flight operations.

---

## 🎯 Goal

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:
- Understand the constraints and data requirements for air traffic scenario generation
- Apply LLMs to produce plausible traffic configurations
- Evaluate output quality with respect to domain validity
